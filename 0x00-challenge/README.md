FizzBuzz function prints numbers from 1 to n separated by a space.

    - For multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for
      multiples of five print "Buzz".
    - For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".
There's a logical error in this fizzbuzz function. When checking for multiples of both 3 and 5, the condition should be checked first before checking for multiples of 3 and 5 separately
