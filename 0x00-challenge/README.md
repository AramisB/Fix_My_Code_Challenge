1. FizzBuzz function prints numbers from 1 to n separated by a space.

    - For multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for
      multiples of five print "Buzz".
    - For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".
There's a logical error in this fizzbuzz function. When checking for multiples of both 3 and 5, the condition should be checked first before checking for multiples of 3 and 5 separately

2. Print a square with the character #
    
    The size of the square must be the first argument 
    of the program.
There is an error with the conversion of the command line argument to an integer. Using parseInt with a radix of 16 (hexadecimal) for the print square problem would not be appropriate because the size of the square, which is passed as a command-line argument, is expected to be in decimal format, not hexadecimal.

In the print square problem, the size of the square represents the number of rows and columns in the square. This value should be interpreted as a base-10 (decimal) integer because it represents a count, not a hexadecimal representation.

Using parseInt with a radix of 16 would result in incorrect interpretation of the size argument if it's provided in decimal format, leading to unexpected behavior or errors in the program.

Therefore, it's important to use parseInt with a radix of 10 to ensure that the size argument is correctly parsed as a decimal integer, aligning with the expectations of the problem and ensuring proper functionality of the program.

Instead, you should use parseInt with a radix of 10 (decimal) to correctly parse the integer.
